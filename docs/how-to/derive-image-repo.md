# Use The Upstream Image Template

This repository is a leaf Vault image, not a template. Use this flow only when
creating a new application image repository from the upstream
`NWarila/ubi9-application-template`, or when reviewing how this Vault image
was derived from that template.

## Create The Repository

Create the new repository from the upstream template, then work in a branch:

```sh
gh repo create OWNER/IMAGE_REPO \
  --template NWarila/ubi9-application-template \
  --public \
  --clone
```

The GitHub UI path is also fine: choose **Use this template** on
`NWarila/ubi9-application-template`, create the downstream repository, and
then clone it locally.

## First Downstream Edit

Keep the generated repository working while replacing the example:

1. Rename `image.name` in `examples/image-manifest.json` to the real image
   name.
2. Point `application` at the upstream release to vendor: set the artifact
   URLs, version, per-platform SHA256 values, verification mode, and (for signed
   releases) the publisher's PGP key URL. `tools/build_app.sh` downloads and
   verifies that release into `dist/`; there is no `app/` source to replace.
   This Vault repository follows that vendor-release model.
3. Update `application.artifacts[*].path` and
   `application.artifacts[*].sha256` after downloading and verifying the real
   artifacts.
4. Keep `containers/Dockerfile` focused on the UBI 9 root filesystem assembly
   (`microdnf --installroot`) and the final runtime assembly. If the application
   needs a different entrypoint, change `application.binary_path`,
   `runtime.entrypoint`, and the Dockerfile entrypoint together.
5. Update `.github/CODEOWNERS` to a user or team that exists and has write
   access to the downstream repository. Do not use an organization login as a
   CODEOWNERS owner.
6. Update `README.md` and repository-specific docs under
   `docs/decision-records/repo/`.

Run the local contract checks before opening the first pull request:

```sh
python tools/verify.py ci
make image
```

`python tools/verify.py ci` does not need Docker. `make image` needs Docker
Buildx and proves the application artifact, manifest, Dockerfile, and runtime
hardening script together.

## CI Shape

The generated repository already has a build caller. `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`
calls the local `.github/workflows/reusable-ubi-image-build.yaml`, so a new
repository does not need a separate `.github/workflows/image.yaml` to build and
test an image.

Keep the local reusable when the downstream repository is expected to own its
application build details. If a repository should be a thin consumer of the
upstream template workflow instead, replace the local call with a pinned
cross-repository call after review:

```yaml
jobs:
  image-build:
    name: image build + hardening
    permissions:
      contents: read
    uses: NWarila/ubi9-application-template/.github/workflows/reusable-ubi-image-build.yaml@0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
    with:
      manifest_path: examples/image-manifest.json
      image_tag: my-image:ci
      platform: linux/amd64
```

Use a real reviewed commit SHA in the `uses:` line. Do not pin to a branch or
tag.

## Publish Path

The starter scaffold's CI builds with Docker's local `--load` path so runtime
tests can inspect the image. That is not a release-evidence path. Wire a publish
workflow once the registry destination is known, following
[`publish-image.md`](publish-image.md). For a worked example, see this
`ubi9-hashicorp-vault` repository's
[`.github/workflows/publish-image.yaml`](../../.github/workflows/publish-image.yaml).

The publish workflow should push an image by digest, emit BuildKit SBOM and
provenance attestations, create a GitHub artifact attestation for the digest,
sign the digest, and run runtime hardening against the pushed digest.

## Governance Setup

Configure the repository settings before enabling auto-merge:

1. Create or inherit the rulesets described in
   [`../reference/governance.md`](../reference/governance.md).
2. Require the CI, security, and review gates that are expected to block
   merges.
3. Enable secret scanning, push protection, Dependabot alerts, squash merge,
   delete branch on merge, and auto-merge if those are part of the owning
   organization's baseline.

Use `NWarila/ubi9-application-template` as the source of truth for the
scaffold. This `ubi9-hashicorp-vault` repository is one example derivation,
not the thing to derive from. Do not use a partially initialized derived
repository as the canonical example until it has been backfilled from the
template shape and has a green first pull request.
